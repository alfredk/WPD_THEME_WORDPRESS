WPD_THEME_WORDPRESS
===================

Wordpress theme with photo gallery slider and masonry

Not finished but close. Going to try to make it not dependent on pluging and build it in :)

# Must do
Must activate responsive light box plugin to use gallery slider -  to use - Set up plugin settings for your site.
Then create a photo gallery in post or photo post.

Thats it.
